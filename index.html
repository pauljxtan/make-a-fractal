    <h1 class="title">Make a fractal</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Fully client-side fractal visualization</p>

    <p>The fractals here are drawn using a neat technique known as an <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system">iterated function system (IFS)</a>.
        Basically: for a given fractal, we have a set of transformations, each of which may be applied with some
        probability (e.g., 1 out of 10 times). These transformations are applied iteratively over and over - the more
        iterations, the more
        self-similarity emerges (and the cooler it looks).</p>
    <br>
    <p>The charting is done with the excellent <a href="https://github.com/danvk/dygraphs">dygraphs</a> library.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Fractals currently implemented:</p>
    <ul>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern">Barnsley's fern</a>
    </ul>
    <br>
    TODO:
    <ul>
        <li>Select from pre-defined fractal type</li>
        <li>Select number of iterations - this should probably be capped, so maybe choose from a list for now</li>
        <li>For now, plot the whole thing at once - eventually a "real-time" animation would be cooler - need to
            investigate that capability with dygraphs
        </li>
    </ul>
