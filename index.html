TODO
<ul>
    <li>Select from pre-defined fractal type</li>
    <li>Select number of iterations - this should probably be capped, so maybe choose from a list for now</li>
    <li>For now, plot the whole thing at once - eventually a "real-time" animation would be cooler - need to investigate that capability with Chart.js </li>
